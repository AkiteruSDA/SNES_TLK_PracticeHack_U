# The Lion King Practice Hack (SNES)
 This hack is intended to help speedrunners practice the game in the most convenient ways possible. 

 Developer builds of the practice hack can sometimes be found in the \dev\ folder. They may be less stable or have incomplete features.

 Always use an UNHEADERED (USA) rom for patching the practice hack.

## Which Download?

The patch file with "Savestates" in the filename is intended for use with SD2SNES/FXPAK. Super NTs will work if the "jailbreak" firmware is installed. It may cause crashes or serious graphical errors if used with emulators (including Virtual Consoles) or Everdrives.

## How to Patch

The most commonly used tool to apply .IPS patches is [Lunar IPS](http://fusoya.eludevisibility.org/lips/), but you can also use [Floating IPS](https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1040/), [SNES Tool](http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/18/), [ucon64](http://ucon64.sourceforge.net/), or [MultiPatch](http://projects.sappharad.com/tools/multipatch.html), among others. Another option is a web-based patcher like RomPatcherJS (this might particularly help those of you stuck on mobile).

Regardless of which tool you use, the process is the same: you select the .IPS file and a copy of your Lion King ROM file, and it will replace the Lion King ROM with a patched practice hack. Then simply load up the patched ROM in your emulator or flash cart of choice. If all goes well, you're done and can delete the .IPS files if you like.
